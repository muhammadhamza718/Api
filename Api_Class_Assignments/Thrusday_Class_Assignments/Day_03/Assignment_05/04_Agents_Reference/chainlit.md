# Welcome to Context-Aware Agent System! ðŸ”—âœ¨

Hello! I'm your context-aware assistant that maintains conversation history and can reference previous interactions. My system demonstrates sophisticated context management and reference handling capabilities.

## What I Can Do

I'm built with advanced context management that features:

- **Context Persistence:** Maintains conversation history across interactions
- **Reference Handling:** Can reference and build upon previous conversations
- **State Management:** Tracks user preferences and conversation state
- **Context Awareness:** Provides responses based on full conversation context

## Context Management Features

### Conversation History

- **Message Tracking:** Records all user and assistant messages
- **Context Analysis:** Analyzes conversation relevance and patterns
- **History Summarization:** Summarizes long conversation histories
- **Context Filtering:** Extracts relevant context for current queries

### Reference Resolution

- **Entity Tracking:** Maintains awareness of mentioned entities
- **Pronoun Resolution:** Understands references to previous topics
- **Context Linking:** Links related conversation elements
- **State Persistence:** Maintains user preferences and settings

### Smart Context Usage

- **Relevant Context:** Only uses context relevant to current query
- **Context Compression:** Efficient context storage and retrieval
- **Context Expiration:** Manages context lifecycle appropriately
- **Performance Optimization:** Optimizes context for response speed

## How Context Awareness Works

My system demonstrates:

- **Memory Management:** Efficient storage and retrieval of context
- **Context Relevance:** Determining what context is relevant
- **State Updates:** Updating context based on new information
- **Reference Tracking:** Following conversation references and links

## How to Use Me

Try having a conversation that demonstrates my context awareness:

### Start a Conversation

- "My name is Alice and I prefer Celsius for temperature"
- "I'm planning a trip to Paris next week"

### Reference Previous Information

- "What's the weather like there?" (referencing Paris)
- "Can you convert that to my preferred units?" (referencing Celsius preference)

### Build on Context

- "I also want to visit London. How does the weather compare?"
- "What time is it in both cities?"

I'll demonstrate how I maintain context and can reference previous parts of our conversation!
