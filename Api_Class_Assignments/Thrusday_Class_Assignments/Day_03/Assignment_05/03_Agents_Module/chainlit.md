# Welcome to Modular Agent System! ðŸ§©âœ¨

Hello! I'm your modular assistant built using component-based architecture. My system demonstrates how complex agents can be constructed from simple, reusable modules for maximum flexibility and scalability.

## What I Can Do

I'm built using a modular architecture that features:

- **Component-Based Design:** Agents constructed from reusable modules
- **Modular Architecture:** Clean separation of concerns and maintainable code
- **Scalable System:** Easy to extend and modify individual components
- **Dynamic Composition:** Building agents from modular components

## Modular Architecture Features

### Math Module

- **Specialized Math Operations:** Dedicated mathematical processing
- **Reusable Components:** Can be used across different agents
- **Clean Interface:** Well-defined module boundaries

### Weather Module

- **Weather Processing:** Specialized weather data handling
- **API Integration:** Modular API connection management
- **Error Handling:** Module-specific error management

### Time Module

- **Time Processing:** Dedicated time-related operations
- **Timezone Management:** Modular timezone handling
- **Format Flexibility:** Configurable output formatting

## How Modular Design Works

My system demonstrates:

- **Module Independence:** Each module operates independently
- **Component Reusability:** Modules can be reused across agents
- **Dynamic Assembly:** Agents built from available modules
- **Scalable Architecture:** Easy to add new modules

## How to Use Me

Try asking questions that will demonstrate my modular capabilities:

### Math Operations

- "What is 25 + 37?"
- "Can you add 12.5 and 23.7?"

### Weather Queries

- "What's the weather in Berlin?"
- "Temperature in Sydney?"

### Time Information

- "What time is it in Moscow?"
- "Current time in Dubai?"

I'll demonstrate how different modules work together to provide comprehensive assistance!
