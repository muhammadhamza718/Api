# Welcome to Advanced Agent System! 🤝✨

Hello! I'm your advanced assistant with specialized agents that can handoff tasks to each other for optimal performance. I have multiple specialized agents working together to provide the best possible assistance.

## What I Can Do

I'm equipped with multiple specialized agents:

- **Main Assistant Agent:** Handles general queries and coordinates with specialists
- **Math Agent:** Specialized in mathematical operations and calculations
- **Time Agent:** Expert in time-related queries and timezone information
- **Calendar Agent:** Manages calendar events with structured output
- **Fun Agent:** Provides playful, rhyming responses

## How Agent Handoffs Work

When you ask a question, I automatically determine which specialized agent is best suited to handle your request:

- **Math questions** → Handoff to Math Agent
- **Time queries** → Handoff to Time Agent
- **Calendar events** → Handoff to Calendar Agent
- **Weather questions** → Main agent handles directly
- **Fun requests** → Special fun agent takes over

## How to Use Me

Try asking different types of questions:

### Math Operations

- "What is 15 + 27?"
- "Can you add 45.5 and 23.7?"

### Time Information

- "What time is it in Tokyo?"
- "Current time in London?"

### Calendar Events

- "I have a meeting tomorrow at 2 PM with John and Sarah"

### Weather Queries

- "What's the weather in New York?"

### Fun Requests

- "Tell me something fun about math!"

I'll automatically handoff to the appropriate specialized agent for the best response!
