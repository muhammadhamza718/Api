# Day 03 Assignment 01 - Basic FAQ Agent ðŸ¤–

## Overview

This assignment demonstrates the creation of a basic FAQ chatbot using the OpenAI Agents SDK and Chainlit. The agent is designed to answer predefined questions about itself and provide helpful information.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Basic Agent Creation

- **Location:** `main.py`
- **Feature:** Simple FAQ agent with predefined responses
- **Purpose:** Demonstrates basic agent setup and configuration

### 2. Chainlit Integration

- **Location:** `main.py`
- **Feature:** Web-based chat interface using Chainlit
- **Purpose:** Provides user-friendly interface for interacting with the agent

### 3. Message History Management

- **Location:** `main.py`
- **Feature:** Session-based message history tracking
- **Purpose:** Maintains conversation context across interactions

## Predefined FAQ Questions

The agent can answer these specific questions:

1. **What is your name?** - Introduces the agent as FAQBot
2. **What can you do?** - Explains the agent's capabilities
3. **Who created you?** - Mentions the student developer
4. **Where are you from?** - Explains the digital nature
5. **How can I contact support?** - Provides support information

## Technical Implementation

### Agent Configuration

```python
faq_agent = Agent(
    name="FAQBot",
    instructions="...",  # Predefined FAQ responses
    model=gemini_model,
)
```

### Chainlit Event Handlers

- `@cl.on_chat_start`: Initializes chat session
- `@cl.on_message`: Handles incoming messages and agent responses

### Message History

- Stores conversation history in user session
- Maintains context for better user experience

## How to Run

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Required packages: `agents`, `chainlit`, `python-dotenv`, `decouple`

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file with:

```
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key
GEMINI_BASE_URL=your_gemini_base_url
```

### Running the Application

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run with Chainlit
chainlit run main.py

# Or run terminal version (uncomment in main.py)
python main.py
```

## Test Scenarios

1. âœ… Ask "What is your name?" â†’ Agent responds with FAQBot introduction
2. âœ… Ask "What can you do?" â†’ Agent explains capabilities
3. âœ… Ask "Who created you?" â†’ Agent mentions student developer
4. âœ… Ask "Where are you from?" â†’ Agent explains digital nature
5. âœ… Ask "How can I contact support?" â†’ Agent provides support info
6. âœ… Ask unrelated questions â†’ Agent politely redirects to FAQs

## Learning Objectives

- Basic agent creation and configuration
- Chainlit integration for web interface
- Session management and message history
- Predefined response handling
- Error handling and graceful responses

## File Structure
